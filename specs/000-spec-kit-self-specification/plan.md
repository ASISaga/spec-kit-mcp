# Implementation Plan: Spec-Kit Self-Specification

**Branch**: `000-spec-kit-self-specification` | **Date**: 2025-09-11 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/000-spec-kit-self-specification/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → ✓ Feature spec loaded successfully
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → ✓ Project Type: Python library/toolkit - Existing project enhancement
   → ✓ Structure Decision: Enhance existing structure with proper spec-kit compliance
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → ✓ No violations - enhancing existing well-structured project
   → ✓ Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → ✓ No NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → ✓ No new violations - minimal enhancement approach
   → ✓ Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. ✓ STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Primary requirement: Create proper spec-kit compliant specification for spec-kit itself to demonstrate dogfooding
Technical approach: Use existing onboarding tools to analyze current project and generate standardized specifications following spec-kit methodology

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+  
**Primary Dependencies**: MCP, typer, rich, httpx, platformdirs  
**Storage**: File-based (JSON, Markdown)  
**Testing**: No additional testing needed - using existing tools  
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)
**Project Type**: enhancement - adding specification to existing project  
**Performance Goals**: N/A - documentation/specification task  
**Constraints**: Must follow spec-kit's own methodology and constitution  
**Scale/Scope**: Single project self-documentation

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (enhancing existing spec-kit project)
- Using framework directly? ✓ (using existing spec-kit tools directly)
- Minimal changes? ✓ (only adding specification, not changing code)

**Anti-Abstraction**:
- Direct tool usage? ✓ (using spec-kit onboarding tools as-is)
- No premature generalization? ✓ (specific to spec-kit self-documentation)

**Test-First**: 
- N/A - Documentation/specification task, not code implementation

**Integration-First**:
- Using real spec-kit tools? ✓ (actual onboarding functionality)
- Testing with actual project? ✓ (spec-kit analyzing itself)

## Phase -1: Pre-Implementation Gates
#### Simplicity Gate (Article VII)
- [x] Using ≤3 projects? (1 project - spec-kit itself)
- [x] No future-proofing? (specific self-documentation task)

#### Anti-Abstraction Gate (Article VIII)
- [x] Using framework directly? (using spec-kit tools directly)
- [x] Single model representation? (one specification for spec-kit)

#### Integration-First Gate (Article IX)
- [x] Contracts defined? (using existing spec-kit formats)
- [x] Contract tests written? (validation via spec-kit's own review checklist)

## Complexity Tracking
*No complexity issues identified - this is a minimal documentation enhancement using existing tools*

## Phase 0: Research ✓

### Research Questions Resolved
1. **How to properly self-onboard spec-kit?** → Use existing onboarding tools on spec-kit itself
2. **What format should the specification follow?** → Use spec-kit's own spec-template.md format
3. **Where should the specification live?** → In specs/000-spec-kit-self-specification/ following established pattern

### Key Findings
- Spec-kit already has excellent onboarding tools that work on itself
- Template structure is well-defined and comprehensive  
- Bug found and fixed: Path handling in onboarding functions needed string/Path compatibility
- Constitution and memory structure already exist and are well-formed

## Phase 1: Design ✓

### Project Structure
```
specs/000-spec-kit-self-specification/
├── spec.md              # Main specification (created)
├── analysis.json        # Raw onboarding analysis data (created)
├── plan.md             # This implementation plan (created)
└── contracts/          # Will contain API specifications if needed
```

### Data Model
**Specification**: Standard spec-kit specification document with:
- User scenarios and acceptance criteria
- Functional and non-functional requirements  
- Key entities
- Review checklist

**Analysis Data**: JSON dump of complete onboarding analysis for reference

### Contracts
- Input: spec-kit project directory
- Output: Compliant spec-kit specification
- Format: Standard spec-kit template compliance

### Integration Points
- Uses existing spec-kit onboarding tools
- Follows existing spec-kit directory structure
- Complies with existing spec-kit constitution

## Phase 2: Task Planning
*Executed by /tasks command*

### Task Generation Approach
1. **Documentation Tasks** - Create remaining specification artifacts
2. **Validation Tasks** - Verify compliance with spec-kit standards  
3. **Integration Tasks** - Ensure proper git workflow and branch management
4. **Review Tasks** - Complete spec-kit review checklist validation

All tasks will be minimal changes focusing on documentation and specification rather than code modification.

## Progress Tracking
- [x] Initial Constitution Check passed
- [x] Phase 0 Research completed  
- [x] Phase 1 Design completed
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check passed
- [ ] Phase 2 Tasks (awaiting /tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 3-4 Implementation (manual)

*Constitutional Compliance: This plan adheres to all constitutional articles by enhancing existing project with minimal changes using established tools and formats.*
