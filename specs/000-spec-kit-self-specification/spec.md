# Feature Specification: Spec-Kit Self-Specification

**Feature Branch**: `000-spec-kit-self-specification`  
**Created**: 2025-09-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Onboard spec-kit on spec-kit using spec-kit"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí "Onboard spec-kit on spec-kit using spec-kit" - Self-onboarding scenario
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Developers, AI agents  Actions: Onboard, specify, develop  Data: Specifications, code
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: None - self-onboarding is well-defined]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: Use spec-kit tools to create spec-kit's own specification
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable - ‚úì
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Specifications, Projects, Features, Tools
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - ‚úì
   ‚Üí No implementation details - ‚úì
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a spec-kit maintainer, I want spec-kit to have its own specification created using spec-kit's methodology, so that the project dogfoods its own approach and demonstrates best practices for specification-driven development.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** spec-kit exists without proper specifications, **When** spec-kit onboarding tools are run on spec-kit itself, **Then** proper spec-kit compliant specifications are generated
2. **Given** generated specifications exist, **When** developers want to understand spec-kit's purpose, **Then** they can read the specification to understand requirements and user stories
3. **Given** spec-kit has proper specifications, **When** new features are added, **Then** they follow the established spec-driven development workflow

### Edge Cases
- What happens when onboarding tools encounter their own code during analysis?
- How does the system handle circular references in self-analysis?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide MCP server with spec-driven development tools
- **FR-002**: System MUST support project initialization with templates and workflows
- **FR-003**: System MUST enable analysis of existing projects for onboarding to spec-driven development
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate standardized specifications from existing codebases and documentation
- **FR-005**: System MUST support progressive onboarding of features independently
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide CLI tools for managing spec-driven workflows
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain constitutional principles for development consistency
- **FR-008**: System MUST support cross-platform script execution (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate specifications against quality standards
- **FR-010**: System MUST enable creation of implementation plans from specifications
- **FR-011**: System MUST track onboarding progress across multiple features
- **FR-012**: System MUST detect and resolve specification conflicts between features
- **FR-013**: System MUST merge multiple feature specifications into master specifications
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide templates for specifications, plans, and tasks
- **FR-015**: System MUST support integration with AI coding assistants via MCP protocol

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Project**: A software project that can be onboarded to spec-driven development, contains specifications and features
- **Specification**: Formal description of requirements and user stories following spec-kit format
- **Feature**: A discrete unit of functionality that can be specified and implemented independently
- **Tool**: MCP-exposed functionality for analysis, generation, or management of spec-driven workflows
- **Constitution**: Immutable principles governing how specifications become code
- **Template**: Standardized format for specifications, plans, and task definitions
