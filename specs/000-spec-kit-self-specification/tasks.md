# Tasks: Spec-Kit Self-Specification

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/000-spec-kit-self-specification/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✓, spec.md ✓, CLAUDE.md ✓

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → ✓ Implementation plan found and loaded
   → Tech stack: Python 3.11+, existing spec-kit tools
2. Load optional design documents:
   → spec.md: ✓ Specification with user stories and requirements
   → analysis.json: ✓ Complete onboarding analysis data
   → CLAUDE.md: ✓ Agent context file
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Documentation: Complete specification artifacts
   → Validation: Ensure spec-kit standard compliance
   → Integration: Proper git workflow and review
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Documentation tasks = mostly parallel
   → Validation requires completed docs (sequential)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph: Docs → Validation → Integration
7. Create parallel execution examples: Most documentation tasks can run parallel
8. Validate task completeness:
   → ✓ All specification documents created
   → ✓ All validation steps defined
   → ✓ Integration workflow planned
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: Documentation enhancement to existing spec-kit
- Paths relative to spec-kit repository root

## Phase 3.1: Documentation Completion ✓
- [x] T001 Create main specification document at `specs/000-spec-kit-self-specification/spec.md`
- [x] T002 [P] Create implementation plan at `specs/000-spec-kit-self-specification/plan.md`
- [x] T003 [P] Create agent context file at `specs/000-spec-kit-self-specification/CLAUDE.md`
- [x] T004 [P] Create project-level agent context at `CLAUDE.md`
- [x] T005 [P] Generate and save analysis data at `specs/000-spec-kit-self-specification/analysis.json`

## Phase 3.2: Quality Validation ✓
- [x] T006 Validate specification against spec-kit template format in `/templates/spec-template.md`
- [x] T007 Check implementation plan against plan template format in `/templates/plan-template.md`
- [x] T008 Verify constitutional compliance per `/memory/constitution.md` principles
- [x] T009 [P] Run spec-kit's review checklist validation on specification
- [x] T010 [P] Validate all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers are resolved

## Phase 3.3: Integration & Workflow ✓
- [x] T011 Create feature branch `000-spec-kit-self-specification` following spec-kit workflow
- [x] T012 Validate git workflow follows spec-kit branching strategy
- [x] T013 Complete specification review checklist in `spec.md`
- [x] T014 Update execution status in `spec.md` to reflect completion
- [x] T015 Prepare final commit with proper spec-kit commit message format

## Phase 3.4: Validation & Documentation ✓
- [x] T016 Generate quickstart documentation for using the self-specification
- [x] T017 [P] Document lessons learned from self-onboarding process
- [x] T018 [P] Update project README to reference the new specification
- [x] T019 Validate that spec-kit now demonstrates its own methodology
- [x] T020 Complete final review against constitutional principles

## Parallel Execution Examples
**Parallel Block 1** (T002, T003, T004, T005):
```bash
# These can all run simultaneously as they create different files
/tasks T002  # plan.md
/tasks T003  # CLAUDE.md (feature-level)
/tasks T004  # CLAUDE.md (project-level)
/tasks T005  # analysis.json
```

**Parallel Block 2** (T009, T010):
```bash
# These validation tasks can run simultaneously
/tasks T009  # Review checklist validation
/tasks T010  # NEEDS CLARIFICATION validation
```

**Parallel Block 3** (T017, T018):
```bash
# Documentation tasks can run parallel
/tasks T017  # Lessons learned
/tasks T018  # README update
```

## Dependencies
- T006-T010 depend on T001-T005 (validation requires completed docs)
- T011 depends on T001-T005 (git workflow requires content to commit)
- T012-T015 depend on T011 (workflow validation requires branch)
- T016-T020 depend on T006-T015 (final docs require validated content)

## Success Criteria
- [x] Specification follows spec-kit template format exactly
- [x] Implementation plan adheres to constitutional principles
- [x] Agent context enables proper AI integration
- [x] All validation gates pass
- [x] Git workflow demonstrates spec-kit best practices
- [x] Project demonstrates successful self-onboarding
